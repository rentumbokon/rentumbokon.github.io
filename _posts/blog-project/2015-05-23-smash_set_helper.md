<strong>A mobile app that walks players through an entire competitive set obeying the legal community rules and standards of a chosen smash title.</strong>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
Super Smash Bros Melee, a party game released in 2001, still has a competitive following to this day. The competitive ruleset of the game, to turn it from a party game to a competitive game, is extremely verbose. One time I visited a friend's University campus tournament I was suprised to notice that not many people knew or have memorized the competitive rules. I created Smash Set Helper to be a tool for new players in the competitive Smash Bros scene to guide new players through a competitive set without having to memorize a pages full of rules. I expanded this idea to all 5 competitive Smash Bros titles and incorporated their respective competitive rulesets.

<h3>Cool Facts</h3>
It was published on the Google Play Store with over 5000 downloads until it was taken down due to an Android versioning issue that I neglected to patch. I was also featured and interviewed by the competitive community's long-established website called Smashboards, talking about this app.
