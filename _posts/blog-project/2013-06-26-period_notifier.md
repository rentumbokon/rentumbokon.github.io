<strong>A web application compatible with desktop and mobile devices that notifies students, parents and staff of Cranford High School what period of the day it is.</strong>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
My high school guidance councilor would often complain to me that guidance councilors, parents, and administrators never know what class period of the day it is when looking at the clock. I created Period Notifier as an app that takes the current time and associates it to one of the eight periods in a high school day.

<h3>Cool Facts</h3>
I presented Period Notifier as a parting gift for my computer science teacher and guidance councilor before graduating high school. Since then, it is being maintained and updated by the high school's webmaster team. I have been told it is heavily used around the school, especially by the administration.
