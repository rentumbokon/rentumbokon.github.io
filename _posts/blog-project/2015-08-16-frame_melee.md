<strong>A general information mobile application that parses Super Smash Bros Melee characters on frame by frame basis.</strong>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
During development, there was no such thing in the mobile marketplace related to Super Smash Bros Melee. I wanted to compile data (particularly frame data) about the game across numerous pages on the internet into one convenient place. I created Frame Melee so Smash Bros Melee players do not have to scour through the internet looking for information about stages, stats, and frame data. Instead of loading up the game using complicated hacked software and tools, there is an option to compare frame data of any two chosen characters from the available cast.

<h3>Cool Facts</h3>
It was published on the Google Play Store with over 5000 downloads until it was taken down due to an Android versioning issue that I neglected to patch. I was also featured and interviewed by the competitive community's long-established website called Smashboards, talking about this app.
