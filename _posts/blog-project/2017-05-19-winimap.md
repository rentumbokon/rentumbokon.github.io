<strong>A website that creates a heatmap of gamers around the world while connecting people who want to play together (Currently only works for the 5 Super Smash Bros titles).</strong>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
Playing video games in a LAN setting is an endagered culture. This is especially evident for Super Smash Bros Melee, a game still being played by thousands after almost two decades, where there is no online mode. If people want to play that game, there is no easy way to find people to play with. I created Winimap as a way to more easily find people around you area to play with. Using user data, I created a heatmap for people to see if their area has an active gaming scene. I also allow people to create statuses saying whether they want to play or host a tournament. It also uses proximity to judge whether not a location is close or not.

<h3>Cool Facts</h3>
It has website sign-ups from all around the world filling the global heatmap.
