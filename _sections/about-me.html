        <p> 
            I am a creative and detail-oriented software engineer based in the NJ/NY area. I have experience in application, front-end, and data development with a degree in both Computer Science and Information Technology from Rutgers University. 
            While I do enjoy coding, I recognize the importance of taking the time to understand the business-side of the industry, in which I take leadership and initiative in talking to business users when opportunities arise.
