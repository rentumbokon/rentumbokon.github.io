<p> 
    I am a creative and detail-oriented Computer Science and Information Technology graduate from Rutgers University with experience in both application development (Java, NodeJS) and data development (ETL, Modeling, SQL, Power BI, QlikView, Python). 
    While I do love coding, I recognize the importance of taking the time to understand the business-side of the industry, in which I take leadership and initiative in talking to business users when opportunities arise. 
    Please see my LinkedIn profile for the latest up-to-date information on my skills, education, and experience!
